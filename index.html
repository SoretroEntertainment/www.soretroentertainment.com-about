	<b><big><big><big><big>WHAT IS THIS WEBSITE?</big></big></big></big></b>
	<br>
	Excuse me if I don't have a desire to make a domain to host, 
	but this is my website. It's a website about me, my past memories 
	and my reviews, it's also about my loved ones, even if I don't 
	mention them. I am very much aware of the fact, that nobody will 
	visit this website because it's being hosted on GitHub, which makes 
	it ultimately obscure, I'm fine with it but I'd love people reading 
	my articles...sort of. Despite its obvious esoteric, I'm still willing 
	to share my past life as a child with a big imagination flew inside my 
	tiny clueless brain. People would call it autism, I call it luck, 
	because they'd rather traumatize a child mentally, and psychically. 
	Though, I will not give away my whole personal life for the "You know 
	the damn reason" reasons. But that's all you really need to know about 
	what's happening up in here, other than that, 
	I suggest you start reading articles now.
	<p>
	<br>
	<b><big><big><big><big>WHO ARE YOU?</big></big></big></big></b>
	<br>
	I'm Niko, going under by the alias Soretro. I'm a teen adult who loves 
	to play videogames and... play videogames and I only play those I'm 
	interested playing, so no, you can't make me play trash. Soretro is 
	an alias known for mediocre FNF mods but let me explain, I roll with 
	it because my main preference for videogames are from the millenial era, 
	the new shit just doesn't interest me at all, and if it does like a new 
	Metroid game, I'd stick to the classics. Where do I live? Am I on the 
	planet Earth? I reside in the middle of nowhere, somewhere anytime 
	anywhere everywhere in Russian Federation. Russia? Well that definitely 
	would devalue anything that comes out of my brain, no?
	</p>
	<p>
    <br>
	I admit that I do have some issues: 
    For one, I hate everyone, seriously, everyone. I cannot fucking stand 
	people at all. And yes, it's because you all are not ME. I mean, c'mon, 
	you'd rather be me. If you disagree... well, you won't escape the harsh truth.
    Second, I'm very lazy and I just fucking hate that I haven't done anything 
	for the past 15 minutes, I hate wasting seconds, really. I swear, wasting time is geniunely horrible.
    I also like really violent sex. Yeah, you'll get to hear a lot of media references 
	from me, in that matter it sounds like only a total fucking loser would do. Well 
	I do not fall under that category because, like I said, I play good videogames.
	</p>
	<p>
	<br>
	<b><big><big><big><big>THE PURPOSE?</big></big></big></big></b>
	<br>
	The purpose? This website is a declaration of independence from everyone and everything. 
	I only wish to speak about certain things if they really do matter for me and for this 
	website, so if you complain about not enough articles, blame it on sloth but the I'm 
	the only one who runs the site. Alright but, why is this still needed? 
	You want to know so badly? Okay, imagine this, my site is like my cat (I also 
	have a cat) and we all love cats, right? Ask yourself, who's the owner of this 
	gorgeous kitty cat? Yeah, and that's the point.
	</p>
	<p>
	<br>
	<b><big><big><big><big>WHO ARE YOUR LOVED ONES?</big></big></big></big></b>
	<br>
    My family, my friends, my cat, me.
	</p>
	<p>
	<br>
	<b><big><big><big><big>THE IDEA OF OWNING A WEBSITE IS STOLEN</big></big></big></big></b>
	<br>
    Not quite. I didn't make the site to share the shenanigans of pop cultures, 
	whatever the fuck it is that'd make me a gaming legend, or a legend. 
	I hold no such knowledge and I do not need to claim that title because 
	it's not about how many pokemons you want to fuck, like I said, 
	it's about me. It's my culture, I still preserve my life experiences 
	I've been savouring in my mind, the fucking title of this website 
	cannot get more ironic enough for this statement. I just hope I entertain 
	you with a showcase of my obvious misanthropy and a 
	little bit of critical thinking, if not then you're out of luck.
	</p>
	<p>
	<br>
	<b><big><big><big><big>WHY DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT RETROS?</big></big></big></big></b>
	<br>
    Ironically enough, I always thought of retro games as trash, 
	because it is all fucking trash as I see it. If there's one 
	retro franchise that is bearable to play to say the least, 
	it's obviously Metroid. Full freedom, fun to play, world 
	exploration. HOW IS THAT NOT APPEALING TO ANYONE? Apart 
	from that, I just grew up with the classics, and not 
	trash like Alex Kidd or fucking Megaman for that matter. 
	If me not liking Megaman does grind your gears then don't even 
	trip and bother someone else's website who'd prefer Megaman 
	over anything...You know that still pisses me the fuck off 
	because why in the world would you prefer just a one-way 
	platformer over a puzzle-platformer? Yes, I just compared 
	a pile of elephant shit (Megaman) to the Holy Grail (Metroid).
	</p>
	<p>
	<br>
	<b><big><big><big><big>FOR THE START, WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT YOU FIRST?</big></big></big></big></b>
	<br>
    Super Metroid is my most favourite videogame; 
	Self-love is everything; 
	I hate wasting time on bullshit, I love spending time on good things; 
	I don't consider myself god almighty because only faggots do that shit; 
	I don't smoke pot or pop percs because only losers do drugs; 
	I usually bump my head to The Prodigy and other music I love listening to; 
	I certainly don't treat celebrities, politicians, human being of any kind a god.
